The document provides a tutorial on data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn with the Iris dataset

Matplotlib and Seaborn are two popular Python libraries used for data visualization. They serve different purposes and can be used together to create effective and informative plots. Here’s a brief overview of each:

Matplotlib

Overview: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a lot of control over the appearance of your plots and is highly customizable.

Usage: It is often used for creating a wide variety of plots, such as line charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more. It’s known for its flexibility and ability to produce publication-quality figures.

Seaborn

Overview: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex plots and includes many built-in themes and color palettes.

Usage: It’s particularly useful for statistical plots, such as heatmaps, violin plots, and pair plots. Seaborn also integrates well with Pandas DataFrames, making it easy to work with data.

1. **Pair Plot**: Visualizes pairwise relationships between variables in the dataset.
  
2. **Pie Chart**: Shows the frequency of different species in the Iris dataset.
  
3. **Scatter Plot**: Illustrates the relationship between sepal length and sepal width.

4.**Joint Plot**: Combines scatter plots and histograms to show the relationship and distribution of two variables.
   
5. **KDE Plot**: Shows the distribution of variables using a continuous probability density curve for both sepal and petal dimensions in the Setosa species.
